# Introduction to the Project

The website Gravity Gym was created for the business to advertise and enlighten both present and new gym members. This website provides existing and prospective gym members with information about the facility. 

Gravity Gym is a Gym in London and they offer a variety of services. For example, personal trainers, various classes, swimming, sauna and steam. The owner wants to increase the number of people that show interest in their gym. The aim of this project is to reach out to a wide range of audiences, ranging from individuals who want to get fit and healthy to individuals who want to relax (e.g. via sauna etc) and make friends. 

This website provides users with basic information of the website, such as, where the gym is based, what facilities are available, what classes they have and what benefits are their for members. Users are also able to contact the owner through 'Contact Us' page, phone number or social media platforms which can be found at the footer of every page. 

Users can get in contact with the client via the contact page or by redirecting to their social media pages.

# Design choices



#### Color Scheme

**INITIAL COLOR SCHEME**

For the colors, I decided to choose a color that symbolizes strength, passion and confidence. For this reason I chose a red color. I also chose black and white color for a neat and modern appearance. 

The following color theme was used:

|Red        |Black          |White          |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
|![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/color-theme-red.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/color-theme-black.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/color-theme-white.png)

**FINAL COLOR SCHEME**

Whilst testing the website pages using Lighthouse and Wave, a common problem encountered was contrast issues. The colors chosen were not compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Hence different color scheme was chosen.

This time I chose to go for a green color that is pleasing to the eye. I chose green because it symbolizes balance, harmony and nature. It is a color that aims to energize and relax the body. 

Hence, my final color scheme for this project is: 

|Green        |Black          |White          |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
|![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/color-theme-green.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/color-theme-black.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/screenshots/color-theme-white.png)


A three color rule is used for this website:
* One main color
* One complementary color
* One accent color

Where main color is black, the complementary color is white. Where main color is white, the complementary color is black. Accent color is green. 

Instead of having a single background color, the pages are designed that black and white colors are used in turns. For instance, if one part of the page is black, then the next part of the webpage is white. This is done to prevent the website from being boring and the keep the user interested in scrolling further down. It also helps break down sections within a page. When the background color changes, it means its a different section. 

For those sections where the background color is white, the font color is black. For those sections where the background color is black, the font color is white. These colors are used as it helps with contrast, and does not strain the eye whilst giving it a neat look.

Green color is used to make certain sections standout, or to highlight a specific element. For example, links upon hover will change its color to green. This is to inform user, that this is what they are hovering on. It is also used to highlight active sections, informing users thats this is the page they are currently on. It is also used at the footer of the page, to highlight the different section of the footer. Furthermore it is used for icons on the plans page to make the comparisons table more interesting.

<br>

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)

#### Typography

For typography [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. I used the following fonts: 
* [**Barlow**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=barlow) - For body text
* [**Fjalla One**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fjalla+One?query=fjalla) - For headings

These fonts were used together with CSS functions of 'font-weight' and 'letter-spacing' to give a light, neat and easy to read font. The font size is changed depending on the device size. 

Only 2 fonts was used as I wanted to keep the website simple and consistent. 

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)

#### Imagery

A range of images have been used throughout the website for various purposes. For example:
* **Hero image** - is used to grab users attention
* **Testimonial images** - to assure users that real people have left feedback which can be referenced back to, by using their names. 
* **Gallery images** - to inform users of what the gym looks like and build an interest within the user for the gym. 
* **Background image** - within the contact us page, to make the page slightly more interesting as this page did not include anything else.

# Wireframes

* Mobile Wireframes - [Click here](/assets/documents/mobile-wireframe.pdf)
* Tablet  Wireframes - [Click here](/assets/documents/tablet-wireframe.pdf)
* Desktop  Wireframes - [Click here](/assets/documents/desktop-wireframe.pdf)

**NOTE** For some pages 2 designs have been created. The one that looks better whilst creating the website will be used. 

The wireframe designed is similar to my final product, however, there are some differences. The table below outlines the differences. The differences between the wireframes are identical across different device sizes.

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)

>Click below, on the relevant headings to expand

<details>

**<summary>Header</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed to include the logo, organization name and the menu all in one line. 
    * However when designing it, the header looked very crowded. 
    * Hence the navigation menu was moved on to the next line. 
* Furthermore, according to the wireframe, the header and menu was designed to be sticky as the user scrolls the page. This design was not carried forward to the final design. 
    * This is because as the design changed, the header took far much more space than anticipated occupying a large portion of the viewport. 
    * To overcome this issue, a 'Back to top' button was implemented instead.

<br>

**Results:**

|Device design          |Desired Results            |Final Results          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|**Mobile**         |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/mobile-header-1.png)  |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/mobile-header-2.png)      v
|**Tablet**         |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/tablet-header-1.png)  |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/tablet-header-2.png)      |
|**Desktop**        |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/desktop-header-1.png) |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/desktop-header-2.png)     |

</details>

<details>

**<summary>Personal Trainer section</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframes design does not include a section for personal trainer. 
* Adding another section similar to 'Get Started' section made the page look more aesthetic. Hence, a 'Personal Trainer' section is added. 

<br>

**Results:**

|Device design          |Desired Results            |Final Results          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|**Mobile**         |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/mobile-pt-1.png)  |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/mobile-pt-2.png)      |
|**Tablet**         |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/tablet-pt-1.png)  |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/tablet-pt-2.png)      |
|**Desktop**        |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/desktop-pt-1.png) |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/desktop-pt-2.png)     |

</details>

<details>

**<summary>Facilities</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed the facilities section to be of 3-4 columns. 
* However when designing it, the facilities section looked very crowded. Hence the facility section is designed to be 2 columns instead of 3-4 columns.

<br>

**Results:**
|Device design          |Desired Results            |Final Results          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
|**Mobile**         |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/mobile-facilities-1.png)  |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/mobile-facilities-2.png)      |
|**Tablet**         |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/tablet-facilities-1.png)  |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/tablet-facilities-2.png)      |
|**Desktop**        |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/desktop-facilities-1.png) |![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/desktop-facilities-2.png)     |

</details>

<details>

**<summary>Membership Queries</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed to end the page with discounts. However, an extra container was added for 'membership queries' as the page did not fit the planned design. 
* The designed planned which is alternate containers colors of black, white, black, white, black. 
* Without adding the extra container, the last container would be black container which merges with the footer background. 
* Furthermore, the two containers would not be separated. Hence, an extra container was added.

<br>

**Results:**
|Device design          |Desired Results            |Final Results          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|

### Code

* **Invert logo** - Homepage uses a logo obtained from another source. However, the background colour was black. I could have edited the logo to make it white, however, this could be time consuming and may not give me the results I wanted. Hence after a bit of research, I came across this [code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/invert) which allowed me to invert the logo colour using css. 
* **Animation** - The homepage includes animation which works when content is on viewport. The animation plays everytime the content comes on viewport. The code has been obtained using AI method from a website called [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/). However, the exact code can only be viewed once logged in. Hence, the code can be viewed through these images: [Image 1](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-1.png), [Image 2](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-2.png). The code was updated using the same source for it to be responsive for mobile devices. The code can be viewed through these images: [Image 3](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-3.png), [Image 4](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-4.png).
* **Footer** - Footer was coded to be at the bottom of the page, however, the code was making it stick. I tried using other options such as making the body position relative and footer position absolute, however it did not give me the results I wanted. The footer would appear just below the content of the webpage. If the page has no content, the footer would appear below the nav, however, I wanted it to be at the bottom of the page even if there is no content. I used [DEV](https://dev.to/nehalahmadkhan/how-to-make-footer-stick-to-bottom-of-web-page-3i14) to help me sort this problem. 
* **Centering image** - I was struggling to center the image in the contact us page which acts as a background for the form section. I used [this website](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/absolute-center-vertical-horizontal-an-image/) to help me position the image in the center.
* **Styling input fields** - I wanted to style the input fields but I did not know how to target them. I used [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp) to help me target the input fields to achieve the look I want. 
* **Tabs** - Tabs was used for adding classes schedules. Tabs was used instead of tables in order to prevent overload of information at viewport. [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp) was used to create tabs, its content and for its styling. 
* **Table Row Hover** - To enable a more focused view for the row, the row is highlighted. [This website](https://www.textfixer.com/tutorials/highlight-table-row.php) is used to obtain the code for highlighting a row upon hovering the row. 
* **Collapsible tabs for markdown** - [This website](https://gist.github.com/pierrejoubert73/902cc94d79424356a8d20be2b382e1a) was used to get the code to collapse sections within the markdown document. Collapsible section was used due to large amount of screenshots and tables present. 
* **Checkbox size** - For extra extra large devices, the checkbox appeared to be very tiny. I could not figure out how to icnrease the size. [This website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306924/can-i-change-the-checkbox-size-using-css) had a code which resolved the issue. 
* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap was used to design the website and to make it responsive. The code from bootstrap is excessively modified to make this website as unique as possible.
