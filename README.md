### Code

* **Invert logo** - Homepage uses a logo obtained from another source. However, the background colour was black. I could have edited the logo to make it white, however, this could be time consuming and may not give me the results I wanted. Hence after a bit of research, I came across this [code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/invert) which allowed me to invert the logo colour using css. 
* **Animation** - The homepage includes animation which works when content is on viewport. The animation plays everytime the content comes on viewport. The code has been obtained using AI method from a website called [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/). However, the exact code can only be viewed once logged in. Hence, the code can be viewed through these images: [Image 1](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-1.png), [Image 2](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-2.png). The code was updated using the same source for it to be responsive for mobile devices. The code can be viewed through these images: [Image 3](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-3.png), [Image 4](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-4.png).
* **Footer** - Footer was coded to be at the bottom of the page, however, the code was making it stick. I tried using other options such as making the body position relative and footer position absolute, however it did not give me the results I wanted. The footer would appear just below the content of the webpage. If the page has no content, the footer would appear below the nav, however, I wanted it to be at the bottom of the page even if there is no content. I used [DEV](https://dev.to/nehalahmadkhan/how-to-make-footer-stick-to-bottom-of-web-page-3i14) to help me sort this problem. 
* **Centering image** - I was struggling to center the image in the contact us page which acts as a background for the form section. I used [this website](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/absolute-center-vertical-horizontal-an-image/) to help me position the image in the center.
* **Styling input fields** - I wanted to style the input fields but I did not know how to target them. I used [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp) to help me target the input fields to achieve the look I want. 
* **Tabs** - Tabs was used for adding classes schedules. Tabs was used instead of tables in order to prevent overload of information at viewport. [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp) was used to create tabs, its content and for its styling. 
* **Table Row Hover** - To enable a more focused view for the row, the row is highlighted. [This website](https://www.textfixer.com/tutorials/highlight-table-row.php) is used to obtain the code for highlighting a row upon hovering the row. 



* template for grid taken from Bootstrap and heavily modified 
* Floating buttons from w3schools 
* [example video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:code_institute+DIWAD_MS1+1/courseware/5cc55f6df9fe41cc8dcb4d665a251ded/8341150079674a76b87da0143c45f6f9/)

## When to write this documentation?
### Before coding 
* UX Section
### During coding 
* when you encounter bugs - this should be added to the testing sections 
* When codes online have been used to solve issues experienced 
* for media that you did not create yourself - saying you got it from this and this website is not sufficient. Must link it to the orignial owner, or website. 
### After coding
* Deployment - steps taken to deploy the website 
    * [Refer Back to this video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:code_institute+DIWAD_MS1+1/courseware/5cc55f6df9fe41cc8dcb4d665a251ded/8341150079674a76b87da0143c45f6f9/)
    * site deployed to GitHub Pages 
    * It should also include steps to run the code 
    * Document steps to clone, install and run the code 

* Testing 
    * if large enough - use a seperate MD file
    * browser compatibility, any specific needs 
    * refer back to user stories 
    * use online validators 
    * use lighthouse in chrome devtools  to check your site for performance, best practices and accessibility. Remember to  document these tools in your README file as well.
    * Navigation Links 
    * Each test should include: Expected (What is expected), Testing (How did you test it), Results (What results did you get), Fixes (If you did not get the results, how did you fix it), Re-run it if needed. 
    * Provide screenshots 
    * Include bug section - of difficult bugs and how did you fix it 

    **MUST INCLUDE ALL THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS TAKEN FOR THE ASSESSORS AND IMPORTANT POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS**
