# Introduction to the Project

The website Gravity Gym was created for the business to advertise and enlighten both present and new gym members. This website provides existing and prospective gym members with information about the facility. 

Gravity Gym is a Gym in London and they offer a variety of services. For example, personal trainers, various classes, swimming, sauna and steam. The owner wants to increase the number of people that show interest in their gym. The aim of this project is to reach out to a wide range of audiences, ranging from individuals who want to get fit and healthy to individuals who want to relax (e.g. via sauna etc) and make friends. 

This website provides users with basic information of the website, such as, where the gym is based, what facilities are available, what classes they have and what benefits are their for members. Users are also able to contact the owner through 'Contact Us' page, phone number or social media platforms which can be found at the footer of every page. 

Users can get in contact with the client via the contact page or by redirecting to their social media pages.

### Code

* **Invert logo** - Homepage uses a logo obtained from another source. However, the background colour was black. I could have edited the logo to make it white, however, this could be time consuming and may not give me the results I wanted. Hence after a bit of research, I came across this [code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/invert) which allowed me to invert the logo colour using css. 
* **Animation** - The homepage includes animation which works when content is on viewport. The animation plays everytime the content comes on viewport. The code has been obtained using AI method from a website called [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/). However, the exact code can only be viewed once logged in. Hence, the code can be viewed through these images: [Image 1](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-1.png), [Image 2](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-2.png). The code was updated using the same source for it to be responsive for mobile devices. The code can be viewed through these images: [Image 3](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-3.png), [Image 4](/assets/images/screenshots/taskade-4.png).
* **Footer** - Footer was coded to be at the bottom of the page, however, the code was making it stick. I tried using other options such as making the body position relative and footer position absolute, however it did not give me the results I wanted. The footer would appear just below the content of the webpage. If the page has no content, the footer would appear below the nav, however, I wanted it to be at the bottom of the page even if there is no content. I used [DEV](https://dev.to/nehalahmadkhan/how-to-make-footer-stick-to-bottom-of-web-page-3i14) to help me sort this problem. 
* **Centering image** - I was struggling to center the image in the contact us page which acts as a background for the form section. I used [this website](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/absolute-center-vertical-horizontal-an-image/) to help me position the image in the center.
* **Styling input fields** - I wanted to style the input fields but I did not know how to target them. I used [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp) to help me target the input fields to achieve the look I want. 
* **Tabs** - Tabs was used for adding classes schedules. Tabs was used instead of tables in order to prevent overload of information at viewport. [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp) was used to create tabs, its content and for its styling. 
* **Table Row Hover** - To enable a more focused view for the row, the row is highlighted. [This website](https://www.textfixer.com/tutorials/highlight-table-row.php) is used to obtain the code for highlighting a row upon hovering the row. 
* **Collapsible tabs for markdown** - [This website](https://gist.github.com/pierrejoubert73/902cc94d79424356a8d20be2b382e1a) was used to get the code to collapse sections within the markdown document. Collapsible section was used due to large amount of screenshots and tables present. 
* **Checkbox size** - For extra extra large devices, the checkbox appeared to be very tiny. I could not figure out how to icnrease the size. [This website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/306924/can-i-change-the-checkbox-size-using-css) had a code which resolved the issue. 
* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap was used to design the website and to make it responsive. The code from bootstrap is excessively modified to make this website as unique as possible.
