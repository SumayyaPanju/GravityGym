# Design choices



#### Color Scheme

**INITIAL COLOR SCHEME**

For the colors, I decided to choose a color that symbolizes strength, passion and confidence. For this reason I chose a red color. I also chose black and white color for a neat and modern appearance. 

The following color theme was used:

|Red        |Black          |White          |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
|![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/color-theme-red.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/color-theme-black.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/color-theme-white.png)

**FINAL COLOR SCHEME**

Whilst testing the website pages using Lighthouse and Wave, a common problem encountered was contrast issues. The colors chosen were not compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Hence different color scheme was chosen.

This time I chose to go for a green color that is pleasing to the eye. I chose green because it symbolizes balance, harmony and nature. It is a color that aims to energize and relax the body. 

Hence, my final color scheme for this project is: 

|Green        |Black          |White          |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
|![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/color-theme-green.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/color-theme-black.png)|![Screenshot](/assets/images/readme/wireframes/color-theme-white.png)


A three color rule is used for this website:
* One main color
* One complementary color
* One accent color

Where main color is black, the complementary color is white. Where main color is white, the complementary color is black. Accent color is green. 

Instead of having a single background color, the pages are designed that black and white colors are used in turns. For instance, if one part of the page is black, then the next part of the webpage is white. This is done to prevent the website from being boring and the keep the user interested in scrolling further down. It also helps break down sections within a page. When the background color changes, it means its a different section. 

For those sections where the background color is white, the font color is black. For those sections where the background color is black, the font color is white. These colors are used as it helps with contrast, and does not strain the eye whilst giving it a neat look.

Green color is used to make certain sections standout, or to highlight a specific element. For example, links upon hover will change its color to green. This is to inform user, that this is what they are hovering on. It is also used to highlight active sections, informing users thats this is the page they are currently on. It is also used at the footer of the page, to highlight the different section of the footer. Furthermore it is used for icons on the plans page to make the comparisons table more interesting.

<br>

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)

#### Typography

For typography [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used. I used the following fonts: 
* [**Barlow**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?query=barlow) - For body text
* [**Fjalla One**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fjalla+One?query=fjalla) - For headings

These fonts were used together with CSS functions of 'font-weight' and 'letter-spacing' to give a light, neat and easy to read font. The font size is changed depending on the device size. 

Only 2 fonts was used as I wanted to keep the website simple and consistent. 

[BACK TO TOP](#table-of-contents)

#### Imagery

A range of images have been used throughout the website for various purposes. For example:
* **Hero image** - is used to grab users attention
* **Testimonial images** - to assure users that real people have left feedback which can be referenced back to, by using their names. 
* **Gallery images** - to inform users of what the gym looks like and build an interest within the user for the gym. 
* **Background image** - within the contact us page, to make the page slightly more interesting as this page did not include anything else.

# Wireframes

* Mobile Wireframes - [Click here](/assets/documents/mobile-wireframe.pdf)
* Tablet  Wireframes - [Click here](/assets/documents/tablet-wireframe.pdf)
* Desktop  Wireframes - [Click here](/assets/documents/desktop-wireframe.pdf)

**NOTE** For some pages 2 designs have been created. The one that looks better whilst creating the website will be used. 

The wireframe designed is similar to my final product, however, there are some differences. The table below outlines the differences. The differences between the wireframes are identical across different device sizes.

>Click below, on the relevant headings to expand

<details>

**<summary>Header</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed to include the logo, organization name and the menu all in one line. 
    * However when designing it, the header looked very crowded. 
    * Hence the navigation menu was moved on to the next line. 
* Furthermore, according to the wireframe, the header and menu was designed to be sticky as the user scrolls the page. This design was not carried forward to the final design. 
    * This is because as the design changed, the header took far much more space than anticipated occupying a large portion of the viewport. 
    * To overcome this issue, a 'Back to top' button was implemented instead.

**<summary>Hamburger Menu</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed to include a hamburger menu for mobile phones.
* When designing the actual website, the hamburger menu required JavaScript
* Due to lack of knowledge and experience in this field, this could not be accomplished. 
* Online script was obtained and added to the website, however, the script would not work well. 
* As a result, the same format as tablet and laptop devices was used.  stead.

**<summary>Personal Trainer section</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframes design does not include a section for personal trainer. 
* Adding another section similar to 'Get Started' section made the page look more aesthetic. Hence, a 'Personal Trainer' section is added.

**<summary>Facilities</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed the facilities section to be of 3-4 columns. 
* However when designing it, the facilities section looked very crowded. Hence the facility section is designed to be 2 columns instead of 3-4 columns.

**<summary>Membership Queries</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed to end the page with discounts. However, an extra container was added for 'membership queries' as the page did not fit the planned design. 
* The designed planned which is alternate containers colors of black, white, black, white, black. 
* Without adding the extra container, the last container would be black container which merges with the footer background. 
* Furthermore, the two containers would not be separated. Hence, an extra container was added.

**<summary>Swimming, Sauna and Steam</summary>**

**Explanation:**

* Wireframe was designed to include a table for swimming, steam and sauna schedules instead of tabs.
* Furthermore, colors was used to code for gender specific sections. 
* However, when this design was added to the page, the table made the page look very crowded and the color scheme looked very messy. 
* Hence the same idea that was used for 'classes' schedule was used for the rest of the page - tabs.

A favicon is added for all of the pages. Favicon is used to help users locate the website when users have various tabs open at one time. 

Each page has been given a specific title name. The title informs the user of the content of the page, what the page is about. This information is also used by the search engine.

### Logo and Organization Name

Each page has a logo and the organization name. When clicked it will redirect the user to the homepage. This is designed in this method due to users expectations and normal behavior. In general, when a user clicks on a logo or the name of the business, they are redirected to the home page. Hence the same idea is used for this website.

Navigation bar is designed to be at the top of the page. The name used for each tabs, describes the content of the page. When selected, the user is directed to the page with one click. 

On hovering, the tab and its title changes to green colour (accent colour) which informs the user that this tab can be clicked on. 

On active pages, the same thing happens which informs the user that this is the page they are currently on. 

The navigation menu is designed using bootstrap to make it responsive for various devices.

### Full width image 

The homepage has a full width image to grab users attention. It does not take up the full viewport height in order to inform the user that there is more information below this image, they need to scroll down.

### Animation and JavaScript for images 

Animation is added to the page using CSS stylings. This zooms the images in. However, this only happens once. For this to happen every time the page is at viewport, JavaScript was used. The code for JavaScript was obtained from an external source, referenced under [here](#code). 

Animation and JavaScript is used to add some life to the page, creating a good experience for the users. Without the use of animation and JavaScript, the page would be static and boring.

### JavaScript for buttons 

Animation is added to the page using CSS stylings. When the buttons are selected, the content collapses and comes into the users viewport. 

JavaScript is used to make the page interactive. The user is able to select a button and the content displays as feedback. This keeps the page exciting.

### Footer

The bottom of the footer is designed to include necessary information that users frequently ask. For example, where is the gym located and what are the opening times. It also includes the social links and copyright information. This is done so that information is easily available to users on every page.

### Pages 

The website was initially designed for four pages:
* Home
* Plans 
* Schedules 
* Contact Us

Whilst creating the website, more pages were created than anticipated. These are the extra pages that was created:
* Gallery
* Thank you for membership subscriptions
* Thank you for contact us page
* 404 error page

5 of the pages are accessible through the navigation menu: Home, Plans, Gallery, Schedules and Contact Us. The remaining pages acts as a feedback page for users when they click on a button or go navigate to a page that does not exist.

**Homepage**

After this, the users are informed of what facilities the gym offers, for example, free parking. As the user further scrolls down, they see what other users in the past have experienced. This whole page is designed to motivate the user and encourage them to get a membership with this gym.

## Features Left to Implement

There are a few features that still needs to be implemented:
1. Adding a hamburger menu for smaller devices 
2. Using a modal for images. So that when images are clicked, the images open up in a modal. 
3. Add a live map, and link it to google maps
4. Add payment method for subscriptions

# Improvements

There are a couple of improvements I could make to this project:
* **Cleaner code** - A systemic approach needs to be used when coding this project. Starting with mobile first design and then going up to extra extra large devices. 
* **Classes and IDs** - Personally designed IDs and classes could be used to design this page better. This was done during this project, however, more of it could have been done. This way, any changes that needs to be made, would need to be done once on the CSS.

Hence this source  allowed me to invert the logo colour using css.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The animation plays every time the content comes on viewport. The code has been obtained using AI method from this website. However, the exact code can only be viewed once logged in. Hence, the code can be viewed through these images: [Image 1](/assets/images/readme/taskade-1.png), [Image 2](/assets/images/readme/taskade-2.png). The code was updated using the same source for it to be responsive for mobile devices.

| **Footer**                        | [Link](https://dev.to/nehalahmadkhan/how-to-make-footer-stick-to-bottom-of-web-page-3i14)   | Footer was coded to be at the bottom of the page, however, the code was making it stick. I tried using other options such as making the body position relative and footer position absolute, however it did not give me the results I wanted. The footer would appear just below the content of the web page. If the page has no content, the footer would appear below the nav, however, I wanted it to be at the bottom of the page even if there is no content. I used this website to resolve this problem.                                                                                                                                         |
