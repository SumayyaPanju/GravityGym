## When to write this documentation?
### Before coding 
* UX Section
### During coding 
* when you encounter bugs - this should be added to the testing sections 
* When codes online have been used to solve issues experienced 
* for media that you did not create yourself - saying you got it from this and this website is not sufficient. Must link it to the orignial owner, or website. 
### After coding
* Deployment - steps taken to deploy the website 
    * [Refer Back to this video](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:code_institute+DIWAD_MS1+1/courseware/5cc55f6df9fe41cc8dcb4d665a251ded/8341150079674a76b87da0143c45f6f9/)
    * site deployed to GitHub Pages 
    * It should also include steps to run the code 
    * Document steps to clone, install and run the code 

* Testing 
    * if large enough - use a seperate MD file
    * browser compatibility, any specific needs 
    * refer back to user stories 
    * use online validators 
    * use lighthouse in chrome devtools  to check your site for performance, best practices and accessibility. Remember to  document these tools in your README file as well.
    * Navigation Links 
    * Each test should include: Expected (What is expected), Testing (How did you test it), Results (What results did you get), Fixes (If you did not get the results, how did you fix it), Re-run it if needed. 
    * Provide screenshots 
    * Include bug section - of difficult bugs and how did you fix it
